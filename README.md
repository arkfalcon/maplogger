# Maplogger BETA

Maplogger is a personal passion project of mine, designed to serve as an interactive tool that guides gamers and completionists alike

**Features:**
- Render a high quality fantasy map
- 2 views: advanced and compact
- Place markers around the map
- Log info about the markers to a 'Notes' tab

**Currently supported games:**
- Elden Ring

**How it works (for the nerds):**
- React.JS + Vite for the frontend development and testing
- Tiles generated using MapTiler Engine 12.2
- Map rendered using OpenLayers (yes i hate myself)
- Icons taken from FontAwesome
